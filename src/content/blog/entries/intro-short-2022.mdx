<p>Ravi Rambaran is a frontend developer in training from Utrecht. This
    is his first attempt to code his own personal and cool looking
    website for his hobby, art. His employer
    <a rel="noopener" href="https://seniorweb.nl" target="_blank"
        >SeniorWeb</a>
    is helping making this an actual possibility. He creates art for and
    about various subjects, with a strong preference for fantasy/sci-fi
    art. He actually has three stuffed Minions-pluchies... <br />
