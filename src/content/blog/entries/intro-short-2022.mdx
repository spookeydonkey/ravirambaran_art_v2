  Ravi Rambaran is a frontend developer in training from Utrecht. This is his
  first attempt to code his own personal and cool looking website for his hobby,
  art. His employer
  <a rel="noopener" href="https://seniorweb.nl" target="_blank">
    SeniorWeb
  </a>
  is helping making this an actual possibility. He creates art for and about
  various subjects, with a strong preference for fantasy/sci-fi art. He actually
  has three stuffed Minions-pluchies...
